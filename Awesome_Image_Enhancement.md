## Learning a Simple Low-light Image Enhancer from Paired Low-light Instances CVPR2023
**Purpose:** The purpose of this paper is to introduce PairLIE, an unsupervised approach for low-light image enhancement that learns adaptive priors from low-light image pairs. The paper aims to improve contrast and restore details for images captured in low-light conditions.

**Method:** PairLIE is an unsupervised approach for low-light image enhancement that learns adaptive priors from low-light image pairs. The method consists of two main steps:

1. Retinex Decomposition: The network is expected to generate the same clean images as the two inputs share the same image content. To achieve this, the network is imposed with the Retinex theory and makes the two reflectance components consistent.
2. Self-Supervised Mechanism: To assist the Retinex decomposition, inappropriate features in the raw image are removed with a simple self-supervised mechanism.

**Datasets:**
* SICE (part2)
*  LOL (training set)

**Hardware:** Not mentioned

## SNR-Aware Low-light Image Enhancement CVPR2022
**Method:** The SNR-Aware Low-light Image Enhancement method uses a signal-to-noise-aware framework consisting of a new SNR-aware transformer design and a convolutional model to adaptively enhance low-light images in a spatial-varying manner. The method first obtains an SNR map using a simple and yet effective strategy, which estimates the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the input low-light image. The SNR map is then used to guide the framework to learn different enhancement operations adaptively for image regions of varying signal-to-noise ratios. In the deepest hidden layer of the framework, a new self-attention module is used to enhance pixels in a spatial-varying manner and avoid inaccurate information from regions of very low SNR. The method has been shown to achieve superior perceptual quality and consistently outperform other approaches on seven benchmarks.

## Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation for Low-Light Image Enhancement CVPR2020
**Methos:** It does not require any paired or unpaired data in the training process, and it is trained without any reference image. Instead of performing image-to-image mapping, the task is reformulated as an image-specific curve estimation problem. The proposed method takes a low-light image as input and produces high-order curves as its output. These curves are then used for pixel-wise adjustment on the dynamic range of the input to obtain an enhanced image. The curve estimation is carefully formulated so that it maintains the range of the enhanced image and preserves the contrast of neighboring pixels.

**Datasets:** 360 multi-exposure sequences from the Part1 of SICE dataset

**Hardware:** One NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU
